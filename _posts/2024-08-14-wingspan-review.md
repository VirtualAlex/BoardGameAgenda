The game revolves around attracting birds to your wildlife preserves. Each bird card features:

- **Stunning artwork** by Natalia Rojas, Ana Maria Martinez, and Beth Sobel
- **Real bird facts** that make learning fun
- **Unique abilities** that create satisfying engine-building combos

### Core Mechanics

1. **Engine Building**: Birds you play trigger powerful combinations
2. **Dice Rolling**: Custom dice determine available food
3. **Card Drafting**: Choose birds strategically for your habitats

## The Gameplay Experience

Wingspan plays smoothly across its four rounds. Each turn, you'll choose one of four actions:

- **Play a bird** from your hand
- **Gain food** from the dice tower
- **Lay eggs** to expand your options
- **Draw bird cards** for future plays

The beauty lies in how these actions interconnect. As you add birds to your habitats, they create cascading effects that make later turns more powerful and satisfying.
